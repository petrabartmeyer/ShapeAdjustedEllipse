The main file is called shape_adjusted_calculation.m. It contains two mais functions, one for myelinated axons and another for unmyelinated axons.


The routine for myelinated axons will require a secondary function called linear_sum_assignment.m. This routine uses the Hungarian Method to link the Fiber and Axon measuraments for the same structure.


How to run the analysis.

1- Open the file shape_adjusted_calculation.m in the Matlab
2- Use the botton RUN (the green arrow on the EDITOR tab)
3- The command window will display the following questions:
 a- Please, insert the name of the spreadsheet without quotes (" ") or (''). The expected extentions are .xlsx, xls, or .csv: 
 b- Please, insert a name for the output file with the desired extension (.xlsx, xls, or .csv): 
 c- Please insert 1 to analyse myelinated axons. For unmyelinated axons insert 0: 
 
 After each one of the question you have to insert the desired answer and press ther ENTER key
 
 4- The message "The analysis will start now..." will appear in the command window, indicating that there is no need of extra manual input
 5- The message "Your analysis is finished." indicates that the analysis is finished and the spreadsheet is already available in the folder indicated in the step 3b
