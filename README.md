# ShapeAdjustedEllipse
Codes for axon diameter calculation using the Shape Adjusted Ellipse method

This folder contains three implementations for the shape adjusted ellipse method for calculating axon diameter.

The subfolder Julia contains the implementation using the Julia language, using the packages Roots.jl. The input file is a matrix with the diameter and area of the axon (in a list), and the output is a.csv file with the calculations.
The subfolder Matlab contains the implementation using the Matlab language. The input file is a spreadsheet with the data about the axons, and the output is a.csv file with the calculations.
The subfolder Excel contains a spreadsheet with an example of how to calculate the axon diameter in this platform.

The ownership of the results and the implementation in these folders are from Petra Bartmeyer, Natalia Biscola, and Leif Havton.
